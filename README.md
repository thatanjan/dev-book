## Why Confession?

Imposter syndrome happens to all of us. Because we share our success stories.
And others think that they are not capeable of anything. But the don't see the
failures.

## How Confession will solve Imposter Syndrome?

This where Confession will come into play. In this application, people will share
not only their success but also their failures. Then others will know about
behind the scene. And they won't have the imposter syndrome.
